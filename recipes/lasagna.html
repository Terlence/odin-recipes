    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a recipe for Lasagna</p>
        <p>Lasagna is a classic low-cost homemade dish that is filling and makes for great leftovers</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>cheese</li>
            <li>onion</li>
            <li>garlic</li>
            <li>carrot</li>
            <li>celery</li>
            <li>beef</li>
            <li>canned tomato</li>
            <li>tomato paste</li>
            <li>beef stock cubes</li>
            <li>bay leaves</li>
            <li>thyme</li>
            <li>oregano</li>
            <li>worcestershire</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Traditional version is made using a mix of pork and beef. If you wish to do this, use 300g/10oz pork and 700g/1.4lb beef. Pork adds a bit of richness. I do not (usually) do this simply because I feel like the sauce is so beautifully rich anyway (especially with the cheese sauce).</li>
        <li>Use a bold red, like cab sauv, not a light one like pinot. You can skip the wine if you prefer, just use water instead, or beef broth/stock.</li>
        <li>Sugar - add this only if you think your sauce has a tinge of sour which can occur depending on the quality of the tomatoes used.</li>
        <li>Cheese: Use any flavoured melting cheese you want. I dont recommend mozzarella because it doesnt have enough flavour. Also, I have recently discovered that some Tasty Cheese brands do not melt well in béchamel sauces, it can make it a bit floury rather than silky smooth. So it is safest to avoid Tasty cheese. (Tasty is a popular type of Australian cheese).</li>
        <li>Fresh vs dried lasagna sheets: I like using fresh because I feel that it “melds” better with the filling. For DRIED Lasagna sheets, check the packet to see if it needs to be cooked before using. If its labelled “Instant” or “No Cook”, then you can use it without pre-cooking. If it needs to be cooked in boiling water (like pasta), follow the packet directions but regardless of what the packet says, I would recommend adding a good glug of olive oil in the water before adding the lasagna sheets (extra assurance they wont stick together).
            If you use instant dried lasagna sheets, the surface probably wont stay nice and flat, like you see in the photos, as it tends to get “waves” on the surface once cooked. No effect on flavour, its just visual. Also see Note 5 re: sauciness of ragu for dried instant lasagna sheets (for cooked dried sheets, it essentially becomes fresh lasagna sheets).
            Fresh lasagne sheets are sold in the refrigerator section of supermarkets.</li> 
        <li>Ragu Consistency & Making ahead: The Ragu shouldnt be watery and there shouldnt be an excessive amount of sauce. However, if you are using dried lasagna sheets, you do need to ensure that there is enough liquid to rehydrate the sheets. See video to see how saucy my ragu is. This is saucy enough for dried lasagna sheets.
            If you arent using a heavy based pot, you may find you need to add a splash of water during the cook time (heavy pot = heavy lid = clamps down better = less water evaporation).</li>
        <li>SHEET PLACEMENT: If you watch the video, you will see I place the sheets in one direction for one layer, then the next time I place them 90 degrees the other way. This just helps the sheets stay in place a bit better when cutting, but its not a big deal!</li>
        <li>Though there are many versions of Lasagna throughout Italian, typically, strictly authentic Italian Lasagnas are usually made with pancetta, milk and a mix of pork as well as beef in the ragu. They are also made with passata rather than crushed tomato, has not tomato paste, bouillon cubes or Worcestershire and quite often made with white rather than red wine.</li>
        <li>MAKE AHEAD: Lasagna is brilliant for making and and freezing. Cover with foil and reheat in the oven at 180C or microwave it (this is my preferred because I feel like it keeps it more moist). If frozen, defrost before heating. Keeps for 3 days in the fridge.
            Alternatively, assemble then bake later. Just let the sauce cool a bit then assemble the lasagne and bake later, up to about 24 hours is fine.</li> 
        </ol>
